# Iris Dataset Classification - Machine Learning Algorithms Comparison

A comprehensive machine learning project comparing multiple classification algorithms on the famous Iris dataset. This repository implements and evaluates 7 different machine learning models to classify iris flowers into three species based on their physical measurements.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project demonstrates practical implementations of various machine learning algorithms using the classical Iris dataset. Each algorithm is implemented in a separate Jupyter notebook with complete data exploration, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## 🎯 Algorithms Implemented

1. **Decision Tree** - Tree-based classification model
2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** - Distance-based classification
3. **Logistic Regression** - Linear classification model
4. **Naive Bayes** - Probabilistic classification
5. **Random Forest** - Ensemble learning with multiple decision trees
6. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** - Kernel-based classification
7. **Gradient Boosting** - Sequential ensemble learning
